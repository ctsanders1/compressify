# Image-compression executable

Image compression executable to run as pre or post-commit. Compresses images in the same place, builds hash-manifest and stages changed images.

## Install

`npm install --save-dev https://github.com/moovel/web-compress-images-in-same-place.git`

## Usage

Image compression can run as standalone CLI command or used in combination with [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) as post-commit. It will try to read the `--manifest` file and filter the already compressed images. The remaining images in the pipe will be compressed using [mozjpeg](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg) and added to the stage. After compression takes place the hash manifest will be recreated, added to the stage and everything is committed.
